# PAD Dash!

Welcome to PAD Dash, our take on our final collaborative project for CSE 2102. This project was meant to demonstrate project planning and coding collaboration.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- pygame

You can easily download [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) from the site, and pygame by typing `pip install pygame`.

## Running the game
The game doesn't require any other libraries to run. Running `python pad-dash1.py` launches the game.
